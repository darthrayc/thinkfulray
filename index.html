        <h2>About Raymond</h2>
        <p>After graduating from University of Nevada, Las Vegas as a finance major. I found myself invested in more than
            numbers and financial decision making. I felt there was more that I could do than helping others invest in making
            a huge financial decision in their lives. During the Covid-19 pandemic, I found myself wanting to expand my knowledge 
            and learn more when it came to software developing as finance, although it was fun, was not a career choice I could find myself settling in long-term with.
        </p>
        <p>As a student at <span class="thinkful"><b>Thinkful</b></span>, I have started my journey into becoming a software developer and I am excited for what is to come.</p>
        <p>If you are currently searching for a new developer who is ready to take on a challenge, please reach out!
            I am ready to learn more skills and work alongside with other developers to build any latest software.
